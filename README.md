# DSC680 Fall 2020 Portfolio Projects



# Introduction
This repository is a portfolio of DSC 680 projects for Fall 2020. This portfolio will be split into three projects that include analyses and presentations of data. These projects will display my understanding of the skill learned in Bellevue University's Data Science course. Please enjoy looking through the projects.



# Abstract
The following areas of this repository will discuss and explain the objectives of the projects. With this in mind, it is time to talk about the parameters of the projects. Here are the parameters of each of the projects. 


• Report/White Paper

Summarize your business problem/hypothesis

Walk through your method 

5-8 Pages, 4000-8000 words. 

APA References. 

Up to 3 Illustrations @ ¼ page each. 

Up to 1 Illustration @ ½ page. 

PDF 1 Appendix 

• Presentation

Can be in PowerPoint, Prezi or any other presentation tool. You can be creative here and use other tools like blogs, dashboards, etc. but you must have audio 

Presentation should be no longer than 15 minutes – and a minimum of 10 minutes (Remember, these are going on your portfolio, the goal is to gain the attention of potential employers.) 

• Q&A

You must submit 10 potential questions you would receive in a presentation along with your answers in a PDF. 

• Jupyter Notebook or link to your GitHub with your code/dataset.



# Summary of Skills
I used the python environment to perform my exploratory data analysis. I also used the Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly packages and Micosoft's Power BI application for these projects.

This pair plot was created from this project to convey my findings to the public.

This heatmap was created from this project to convey my findings to the public.

## Project Three

This histogram was created from this project to convey my findings to the public.



# Findings
Each of these projects are domain agnostic, data agnostic, and method agnostic. This means that you can pull data from any domain, analyze it using whatever method you deem worthy, and use data that already exists in any form.

## Project One
There is also a clear difference between women who have the presence of heart disease and the women who do not. This was a good base for me to see how many people had the presence of heart disease between the two genders. From this finding I saw that men are more likely to have the presence of heart disease compared to women.

## Project Two
This project was to look at the COVID-19 cases in Los Angeles County. With the evidence that a second wave of COVID-19 is coming in the next few months. I wanted to focus on the number of cases within this county, since it has many well know cities that reside in it. I also wanted to work on a project that relates to the COVID-19 pandemic and my beloved Los Angeles County.

## Project Three
It seems that earthquakes of 5.5 are very common and the magnitudes of earthquakes will be a good metric for predicting. I also see using depth as another good metric for predicting earthquakes. I am thinking in a manner that is like weather forecasting that may not be perfect, but it gives useful information for that day. This would also be useful to local governments that are in the earthquake prone areas. 



# Challenges

## Project One
One challenge comes to mind is how to deal with wildly different results from using different approaches that might have many limitations. I needed to develop a plan to deal with such irregularities that might lead me away to the focus of this project. Another challenge would be the results that are based on gender. This could lead to misleading factors that might not be helpful to all people. 

## Project Two
One challenge that comes to mind is the fact that I am talking about a specific area of California. I know that many people might not know all the cities within Los Angeles County. I had select a few well-known cities. I also had provide a brief explanation on the other cities that includes their demographics and location to Los Angeles. I knew this would be a potential issue, since I wanted to talk about cities that are being affected by COVID-19 in Los Angeles County. 

## Project Three
The challenge for has been looking for a replacement algorithm besides random forest regressor. When I started with the research for this project, I did see some other projects that only used random forest regressor algorithm to evaluate the accuracy of predicting earthquakes. I did not see any projects that used another algorithm when it came to evaluating a model with this type of dataset. Another challenge with this dataset was the amount of missing data, which was time consuming. One other challenge was the terminology of this domain.



# Conclusion

## Project One
The focus of this project was to fit a model that was able to predict the presence of heart disease based on anonymized health profiles of past medical patients. I had experimented with three different classification models to find and analyze the best parameters used for making predictions. Out of the three classification models selected for this project, the Random Forest Classifier with Grid Search was the best with an accuracy rate of 88%. 

## Project Two
The focus of this project was to look at the number of COVID-19 cases in the cities that are in Los Angeles County. The reason is based on, we are going into flu season and a second phase of COVID-19 in Los Angeles County. With that in mind, it is more helpful to look at the number of COVID-19 cases, since the most common way of transmission is through asymptomatic people.

## Project Three
The main objective for this project was to see if it is possible to predict earthquakes. The reason is based on, my upbringing in California where you live with the fact that earthquakes can happen at any time. I propose developing a model that can predict earthquakes from the selected dataset and it can be another tool in use with the mobile applications. My hope for this model would be to give people more time to prepare for earthquakes. Another hope for this model will be to limit the amount of damages and injuries from earthquakes.
